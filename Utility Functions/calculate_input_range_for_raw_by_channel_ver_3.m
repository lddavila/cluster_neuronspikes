function [array_of_max_per_channel] = calculate_input_range_for_raw_by_channel_ver_3(channels_of_current_tetrode,dir_with_channel_recordings)
%raw is an array with the following dimensions
%1) Number of channels
%2) number of spikes
%3) number of data points
%to access all of the data points for the first channel, spike 1 you would index it as in the following example
%raw(1,1,:)
